# Day 03

Took a bit longer to make it through my AoC problems today. I kept reversing my bits.

Yesterday, I wrote a tiny script to create a daily directory, download and save my problem input to a file in that directory and create a starter.py file. That time savings, probably 30 seconds, makes AoC a little more pleasant to play.

Questioning whether I should create a daily .md file in the git to track my thoughts... but also to act as an impetus for a blog post.
